# News

- **I‚Äôm actively looking for Machine Learning System and O1/MLLM/LLM Industrial/Research Opportunity.**

  **This includes**

  - Train more powerful reasoning models like [DeepSeek-R1](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1) and [QwQ](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/QwQ-32B-Preview). 
  - Improve RLHF training frameworks in the direction of reinforcement learning (such as [veRL](https://github.com/volcengine/verl) and [OpenRLHF](https://github.com/OpenRLHF/OpenRLHF)).
  - Develop robust inference frameworks like [SGLang](https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang).

Biography
======
1. My name is erhuer. I will get my bachelor Degree in computer science  with Distinction at University of XiZang in June  2026. Now I am a pre phd student of the National Science Space Center of the Chinese Academy of Sciences,supervised by Prof. [Lei Dai](https://www.nssc.ac.cn/sourcedb/zw/rck/202410/t20241022_7406023.html).

   I have experience in CV and computer systems(both architecture and  high performance machine learning systems), along with extensive  industry research internship experience. This includes:

   - Participating in the pretraining of the Yi-Lightning model at 01.AI.
   - Contributing to ML Infra of the pretraining of the foundation model at ModelBest (with TsinghuaNLP).
   - Participating in the finetuning of the CodeLLM [Raccoon](https://raccoon.sensetime.com/code) (Copilot-like) at SenseTime (with CUHK MMLab).

Research Interests
------
My current passion revolves around building **EFFICIENT** system solutions to AGI (***\*Now I am interested in O1-like models ML Infra\****), this includes:

1. **Machine Learning System**
   - Training: Design more effective training system and algorithms, example includes [BMTrain](https://github.com/OpenBMB/BMTrain).
   - Parameter Efficient Fine Tuning (PEFT): Improve LoRA-like architecture and low bit model compression. example includes [IAPT](https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.771.pdf). 
   - Long context inference: example includes [Cross Layer Attention](https://github.com/JerryYin777/Cross-Layer-Attention).
2. **LLM & LLM applications**
   - CodeLLM
   - Foundation LLM (Yi-lightning)
   - RAG (GraphRAG): Examples includes [PaperHelper](https://github.com/JerryYin777/PaperHelper).

How to edit your site's GitHub repository
------
Many people use a git client to create files on their local computer and then push them to GitHub's servers. If you are not familiar with git, you can directly edit these configuration and Markdown files directly in the github.com interface. Navigate to a file (like [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_talks/2012-03-01-talk-1.md) and click the pencil icon in the top right of the content preview (to the right of the "Raw | Blame | History" buttons). You can delete a file by clicking the trashcan icon to the right of the pencil icon. You can also create new files or upload files by navigating to a directory and clicking the "Create new file" or "Upload files" buttons. 

Example: editing a Markdown file for a talk

Contact
------
- I am very enthusiastic about discussing academic issues or any  interesting project-related topics!  If you'd like to engage in a  discussion or collaborate, feel free to contact me via email at any  time. 
- If you're an undergraduate student feeling uncertain, especially  from a diverse background, and hope to gain some learning experiences  from me, I also warmly welcome that!
