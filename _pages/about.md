# News

- **I'm actively looking for Machine Learning System and O1/MLLM/LLM Industrial/Research Opportunity.**

  **This includes:**
  - Training more powerful reasoning models like [DeepSeek-R1](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1) and [QwQ](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/QwQ-32B-Preview)
  - Improving RLHF training frameworks in the direction of reinforcement learning (such as [veRL](https://github.com/volcengine/verl) and [OpenRLHF](https://github.com/OpenRLHF/OpenRLHF))
  - Developing robust inference frameworks like [SGLang](https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang)

## Biography

My name is erhuer. I will receive my Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science with Distinction from University of XiZang in June 2026. I am currently a pre-PhD student at the National Space Science Center of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, supervised by Prof. [Lei Dai](https://www.nssc.ac.cn/sourcedb/zw/rck/202410/t20241022_7406023.html).

I have experience in computer vision and computer systems (both architecture and high performance machine learning systems), along with extensive industry research internship experience. This includes:

- Participating in the pretraining of the Yi-Lightning model at 01.AI
- Contributing to ML Infra for the pretraining of foundation models at ModelBest (with TsinghuaNLP)
- Participating in the finetuning of the CodeLLM [Raccoon](https://raccoon.sensetime.com/code) (Copilot-like) at SenseTime (with CUHK MMLab)

## Research Interests

My current passion revolves around building **EFFICIENT** system solutions for AGI (***Now I am interested in O1-like models ML Infra***), including:

1. **Machine Learning System**
   - Training: Design more effective training systems and algorithms, examples include [BMTrain](https://github.com/OpenBMB/BMTrain)
   - Parameter Efficient Fine Tuning (PEFT): Improve LoRA-like architecture and low bit model compression, examples include [IAPT](https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.771.pdf)
   - Long context inference: examples include [Cross Layer Attention](https://github.com/JerryYin777/Cross-Layer-Attention)

2. **LLM & LLM Applications**
   - CodeLLM
   - Foundation LLM (Yi-lightning)
   - RAG (GraphRAG): Examples include [PaperHelper](https://github.com/JerryYin777/PaperHelper)

## How to Edit Your Site's GitHub Repository

Many people use a git client to create files on their local computer and then push them to GitHub's servers. If you are not familiar with git, you can directly edit these configuration and Markdown files in the github.com interface. Navigate to a file (like [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_talks/2012-03-01-talk-1.md)) and click the pencil icon in the top right of the content preview (to the right of the "Raw | Blame | History" buttons). You can delete a file by clicking the trashcan icon to the right of the pencil icon. You can also create new files or upload files by navigating to a directory and clicking the "Create new file" or "Upload files" buttons.

Example: editing a Markdown file for a talk

## Contact

- I am very enthusiastic about discussing academic issues or any interesting project-related topics! If you'd like to engage in discussion or collaborate, feel free to contact me via email at any time
- If you're an undergraduate student feeling uncertain, especially from a diverse background, and hope to gain some learning experiences from me, I also warmly welcome that!
