How to edit your site's GitHub repository
------

Many people use a git client to create files on their local computer and then push them to GitHub's servers. If you are not familiar with git, you can directly edit these configuration and Markdown files directly in the github.com interface. Navigate to a file (like [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_talks/2012-03-01-talk-1.md) and click the pencil icon in the top right of the content preview (to the right of the "Raw | Blame | History" buttons). You can delete a file by clicking the trashcan icon to the right of the pencil icon. You can also create new files or upload files by navigating to a directory and clicking the "Create new file" or "Upload files" buttons. 

Example: editing a Markdown file for a talk

Contact
------

- I am very enthusiastic about discussing academic issues or any  interesting project-related topics!  If you'd like to engage in a  discussion or collaborate, feel free to contact me via email at any  time. 
- If you're an undergraduate student feeling uncertain, especially  from a diverse background, and hope to gain some learning experiences  from me, I also warmly welcome that!
